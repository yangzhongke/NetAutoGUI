Procedure to add a virtual monitor to your system (Windows 10 Only!)

- Download our virtual display driver from https://www.amyuni.com/downloads/usbmmidd_v2.zip
- Unpack the zip file to an empty folder, e.g. c:\temp\usbmmidd
- Make sure you read the License.txt file as with any other software product
- Open a command prompt window as Administrator (you cannot add a device to your system unless you "Run As Administrator")
- Run the following commands:
	- cd c:\temp\usbmmid (or whatever destination folder you chose)
	- deviceinstaller64 install usbmmidd.inf usbmmidd (If you are on a 32-bit system, replace "deviceinstaller64" by "deviceinstaller")
	- Make sure you see the message that the drivers are signed by Amyuni Technologies Inc. This is a confirmation that the drivers went through Microsoft driver signing procedure and are virus free
	
- Starting with version 2, the virtual monitor supports the following display resolutions by default:

1024 x 768 pixels
1360 x 768 pixels
1440 x 900 pixels
1600 x 900 pixels
1600 x 1200 pixels
1920 x 1080 pixels [Default Resolution]
1920 x 1200 pixels
2560 x 1440 pixels
3840 x 2160 pixels

After the first step above is executed, you can modify the list of supported resolutions by changing the following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\WUDF\Services\usbmmIdd\Parameters\Monitors

Up to 10 resolutions can be defined through this registry key. The keys should be named from "0" to "9". The (Default) registry value defines the default monitor resolution.

Note that the list of resolutions can also be found in the usbmmidd.inf file that accompanies the printer driver. The inf file should not be modified in any way, otherwise the virtual display driver digital signature is invalidated.

Once you are satisfied with the list of resolutions, you can activate the virtual monitor by running: 
- deviceinstaller64 enableidd 1

With version 2, rou can run this command multiple times to add up to 4 virtual monitors to your system.

The included batch file usbmmidd.bat runs these commands automatically and selects between the 32- or 64-bit version of deviceinstaller.
If you are not comfortable opening a command prompt and entering these commands, right-click on usbmmidd.bat and "Run As Administrator."

That's it. You now have a high definition monitor in your Display Settings. You can change the display resolution, position the monitor, extend the desktop or do whatever you do with a real monitor.

To deactivate the virtual monitor, run the command:
deviceinstaller64 enableidd 0
If ou have added more than one monitor, you should run this command multiple times to remove all monitors.

to reactivate a virtual monitor:
deviceinstaller64 enableidd 1

To completely remove the drivers from your system, you can either go through the Device Manager and uninstall "USB Mobile Monitor Virtual Display", or run the commands:
deviceinstaller64 stop usbmmidd
deviceinstaller64 remove usbmmid
